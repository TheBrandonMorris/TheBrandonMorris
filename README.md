### Hey I'm Brandon!

I'm a Programmer/Publication Specialist, right now I am learning dotnet and building upon my skills in the world of peer programming. My knowledge is primarily in C# as of now, but I have experience in COBOL, Latex, Java and Python. I primarily use GitHub for personal projects, but am trying to get more into Issues and PRs.
